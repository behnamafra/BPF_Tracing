**Characterizing Network Stack Latency Using eBPF**

**Project Summary:**

This project aimed to characterize the latency of packets as they traverse through the network stack, from the interrupt request (IRQ) to the application layer and vice versa. The primary tool used for this characterization was eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter), which allowed for precise monitoring and measurement of latency at various segments within the network stack.

The objectives of the project were to understand the latency the packet arriving on the wire and to measure the interrupt processing latency. These measurements are crucial for optimizing network performance and improving the efficiency of data transmission.

The outcomes of the project included a detailed understanding of network latency and the factors that contribute to it. The project also resulted in a set of tools and methodologies that can be used for future network latency characterization and optimization efforts. The findings from this project have the potential to significantly improve network performance and efficiency.

The findings from this project have far-reaching implications. They not only contribute to the existing body of knowledge on network latency but also provide practical tools and strategies for improving network performance and efficiency. The project stands as a testament to the power of tools like eBPF in network monitoring and paves the way for future research and innovations in this field.
